# DecodeX
DecodeX: A System-Level Exploration of LDPC Decoding across CPU, eASIC, and GPU Accelerators

This repo provides a detailed dissection of how each system organizes its decoding pipeline: from threading and SIMD parallelization on CPUs, offload management and queue-based scheduling in DPDK BBDev, to CUDA kernel launches and memory transfers on GPUs.
